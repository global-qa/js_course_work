##Task:
Course Work
Language - JavaScript

Create tests(using REST API) for:

GET: https://www.random.org/integers/?num=1&min=1&max=1&col=1&base=10&format=plain&rnd=new  

To check the following hypothesis: "For large number of rolls (number of rolls > 1000) distribution of dice points strives to uniform distribution." 

Requirements: tests should check that maximum deviation of dice results is within 5% First test: for 1 dice Second test: for 2 dices (total roll points is a sum of 2 dices)

Hint 1: try 1000, 5000, 10000 number of rolls and see how distribution changes 

Hint 2: think about how to implement the solution in the most efficient way
